This folder contains the "inputfile", a file named "pride and prejudice" and the code. 

To run the code, simply open the python file and run it. The code uses the file named "pride and prejudice"
to get the frequency of the english language.

It decrypts the text placed inside the input file. 

The code outputs a plain text for all possible lengths of the key (ie, it outputs 6 possible plain texts).

After doing a frequency analyis on each of the six, it then outputs the most likely decryption. 


Note: the most likely decryption may not always be right. It is very likely however, that one of the six
previously outputed decryptions will be right. Obviously for larger lengths of encrypted text, the probability 
that a decryption will be likely is higher.
